Here&#8217;s a playlist of 100 songs I listened to and enjoyed in November 2016. The big discovery for me was <a href="http://www.blazefoley.com/" target="_blank">Blaze Foley</a>, an eccentric Austin-based singer-songwriter who was shot and killed while trying to intervene in a dispute in 1989, aged 40. I probably listened to his &#8220;Clay Pigeons&#8221; and various covers of it a couple hundred times last month. It&#8217;s a beautiful song. Enjoy!
