Here&#8217;s the 2008 mixtape I made for my sister. Frakkur&#8217;s &#8220;7&#8221; and Glasvegas&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVrR54zJ0k0" target="_blank">Go Square Go</a>&#8221; appeared between &#8220;Halfway Home&#8221; and &#8220;The Hunter&#8217;s Star&#8221; and Seasick Steve&#8217;s &#8220;Walkin&#8217; Man&#8221; appeared just before &#8220;Song to Bobby&#8221; on the original disc, but Spotify doesn&#8217;t have those songs. Enjoy!
