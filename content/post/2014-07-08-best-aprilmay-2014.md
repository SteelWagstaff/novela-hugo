Here&#8217;s a 6+ hour playlist of songs I listened to and liked in April and May of 2014. Was on paternity leave for a big chunk of this time, getting to know a new being, and away from new music on my computer. It was so worth it. Favorites from this period included Clap! Clap!, Chinese Man, Sun Kil Moon&#8217;s Benji record, Sam & Dave, Bowerbirds&#8217; The Clearing, Jack Rose, Richard Hawley&#8217;s Standing at the Sky&#8217;s End, Agnes Obel&#8217;s Aventine album, Balmorhea&#8217;s Stranger, Dorothy Love Coates, and Brass Bed&#8217;s The Secret Will Keep You.
