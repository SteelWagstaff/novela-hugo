Looking for a 10 1/2 hour playlist? Then let me tell you about this one&#8211;it&#8217;s a big collection of music I listened to and enjoyed in October of this year. Pretty eclectic, pretty varied stuff. Some records I finally got around to listening to in full and would recommend: Bon Iver&#8217;s _22, A Million_; Olafur Arnalds&#8217; _Island Songs_; Juana Molina&#8217;s _Un Dia _and _Wed 21_; Margaret Glaspy&#8217;s _Emotions and Math_; Merissa Nadler&#8217;s _Bury Your Name_;Ciaran Lavery&#8217;s _Not Nearly Drunk_; Conor Oberst&#8217;s _Upside Down Moutain_; and Moses Sumney&#8217;s EP _Lamentations_.
