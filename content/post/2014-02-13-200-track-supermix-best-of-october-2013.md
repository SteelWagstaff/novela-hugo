October was a good music month for me, and as evidence, I submit the following: 200 of my favorite songs from that month. Stuff I was really into in October: Advance Base (I totally fell in love with his _A Shut In&#8217;s Prayer_ record), Tom Brosseau, Black Joe Lewis & The Honeybears, Matthew E. White&#8217;s _Big Inner_ record, Chad VanGaalen, Josh Ritter, Luke Temple, Ted Hawkins, Laura Marling, Adem, Jake Bugg, and Vusi Mahalasela. Enjoy!
