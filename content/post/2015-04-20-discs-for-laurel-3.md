Here&#8217;s the third disc I made for Laurel to listen to while driving around for her job a few years back:



A few songs Spotify didn&#8217;t have in their library: Bonnie &#8220;Prince&#8221; Billy&#8217;s cover of &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugVdiUhlOBk" target="_blank">The World&#8217;s Greatest</a>&#8221; and Frakkur&#8217;s &#8220;7&#8221; appeared after &#8220;Neighborhood #4&#8221; and before &#8220;One Day&#8221;, and Seasick Steve&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjggg1eZt-g" target="_blank">Walking Man</a>&#8221; was the final song on the disc.
