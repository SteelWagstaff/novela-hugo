Despite having a extra 24 hours provided by a glorious leap day, this past February wasn&#8217;t the most musically adventurous of months for me. I didn&#8217;t listen a ton of new music, but did manage to scrape together 29 tracks I listened to and enjoyed in the month (one for each day, I suppose). Favorites from the month included Joseph Arthur&#8217;s _Lou_ [a record of Lou Reed covers], Little Dragon, Sylvan Esso (I finally gave the full record an attentive listen), The Secret Sisters, and Quantic (especially his _Look Around the Corner_ record with Alice Russell).Â Enjoy!
