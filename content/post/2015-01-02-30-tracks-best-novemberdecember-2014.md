I didn&#8217;t listen to a ton of music late in the 2014, apparently. Not a ton of memorable stuff leapt out at me. Some stuff I remember liking: Leif Vollebekk&#8217;s _North Americana_ album, Field Report&#8217;s self-titled record, Other Lives, Tired Pony, Sinkane, and St. Paul and the Broken Bones&#8217; _Half the City_. Enjoy!
