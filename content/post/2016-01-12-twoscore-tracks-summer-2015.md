Here&#8217;s a playlist with 40 songs I listened to and liked in the summer of 2015 [March-July, basically]. Not a ton of variety, in hindsight, but I did really get into John Mark Nelson and Serengeti, and liked the new Brandi Carlile, Mirah, and Hamilton Leithauser records. I also listened to the Crookes a fair amount, but mostly because they&#8217;re from Sheffield&#8211;I don&#8217;t super love their sound, but it was ok, if you&#8217;re into mostly energetic indie pop-rock.

Enjoy!
