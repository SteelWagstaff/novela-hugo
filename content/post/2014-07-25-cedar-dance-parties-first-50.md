Just about every morning, while mom pumps, makes breakfast, and goes jogging, Cedar and I use part of our time together to kick out the jams and have a proper dance party. Some stuff he loves, some stuff he merely tolerates, but we always get his booty moving. Currently his favorite move is moving quickly from standing to sitting while I extend his arms above his head. He laughs and laughs and laughs. It&#8217;s my favorite tradition with him so far. Here are 50 of the songs that we&#8217;ve used in some way as part of our (almost daily) morning dance parties. Enjoy!
