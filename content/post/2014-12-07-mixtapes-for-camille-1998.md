Here&#8217;s the 1998 mix I made for my sister. It&#8217;s missing a few tracks that Spotify didn&#8217;t have: The Silver Jews&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8nnCMig1ro" target="_blank">Honk if You&#8217;re Lonely</a>&#8221; fits between &#8220;Crazy&#8221; and &#8220;Let Me Go&#8221;; P.J. Harvey&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmOMuBYEejc" target="_blank">The Wind</a>&#8221; fits between &#8220;Circles&#8221; and &#8220;P.S. You Rock My World&#8221; and Embrace&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nGn_w_wNVc" target="_blank">Come Back To What You Know</a>&#8221; fits between &#8220;Leicester Square&#8221; and &#8220;Imaginary Love.&#8221; Enjoy!
