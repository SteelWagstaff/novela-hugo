Here are 80 songs that I listened to and liked in August 2014. Five plus hours of music. Very few artists with more than one track on this list&#8211;more akin to the old school mix tapes I used to make. Some favorites from the month: classic Louis Prima (listened to a lot with Cedar boy), Timber Timbre, Arthur Russell, and Benjamin Booker. Enjoy!
