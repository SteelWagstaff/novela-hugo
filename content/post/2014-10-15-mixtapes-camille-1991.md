This week&#8217;s mixtape was the second in a series of 21 mixtapes I made as a Christmas present for my sister Camille a few years ago. The playlist order is messed up because the artists are presented in alphabetical order, which wasn&#8217;t the case on the actual disc, but this is the 1991 mix (featuring only songs which were released in 1991). The only track on the disc which Spotify doesn&#8217;t have in its library was De La Soul&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-2-qVgGQak" target="_blank">Oodles of O&#8217;s</a>.

Early 90&#8217;s music buffs, what did I leave out that you would have included?
