This is the second of the starred song Spotify playlists that I&#8217;m sharing each week. These are all the songs that I starred in January and February of 2013 (the first two months of my current job!). 74 playable tracks (lasting about 4 and a half hours). Listening back through it, I&#8217;m feeling pretty happy about it&#8211;enjoying a lot of these tracks&#8211;lots fewer clunkers than last week&#8217;s post, and fewer albums represented by more than a couple of songs. I think I was a bit enamored of the Thao and the Get Down Stay Down record that had just come out in early February, and was listening to a bunch of Damien Jurado and M. Ward, but that&#8217;s nothing out of the ordinary for me, really. Hope you enjoy.
