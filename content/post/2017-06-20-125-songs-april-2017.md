Here&#8217;s a new playlist made up of nearly eight and a half hours of music I listened to and enjoyed in April 2017. Favorites from April included ANOHNI&#8217;s _Paradise_ record, new records from Jenn Grant, Feist, Johnny Flynn and Big Thief, a live album, _Waterworks_, by Glenn Jones and Matthew Azevedo, and new music from Morton Valence and Quantic. Hope you enjoy!
