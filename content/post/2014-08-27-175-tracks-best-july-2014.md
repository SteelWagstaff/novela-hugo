July was a fantastic month for me, musically, by which I mean that I listened to a lot of great music. Some favorites from the month included Son Lux, Bahamas (Feist&#8217;s guitarist), Actual Wolf, Alex Bleeker & the Freaks, Sarah Jaffe&#8217;s _Even Born Again_, Laura Mvula&#8217;s _Sing to the Moon_, Glenn Jones&#8217; _My Garden State_ record, San Fermin, James Blake&#8217;s _Overgrown_, Alice Boman&#8217;s _EP II_, The Tallest Man on Earth&#8217;s _There&#8217;s No Leaving Now_ record, Lindi Ortega&#8217;s _Tin Star_, and the immortal Roger Miller. Enjoy!
