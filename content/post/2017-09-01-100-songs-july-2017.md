Here&#8217;s a new playlist of 100 songs I listened to and enjoyed in July 2017. Records I had on heavy rotation this month included Nightwares on Wax&#8217; _N.O.W. Is the Time_, Flying Lotus&#8217; _You&#8217;re Dead!_, Glass Animals&#8217; 2014 release _ZABA_, Nathaniel Rateliff&#8217;s _Closer_, Guy Clark&#8217;s _Workbench Songs_, Michael Nau&#8217;s _Some Twist_. A lot of new discoveries for me this month, probably too many to list here. Hope you enjoy!
