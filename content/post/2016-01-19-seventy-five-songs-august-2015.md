Here&#8217;s a playlist of 75 songs I listened to and liked way back in August of 2015 (the month I turned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record" target="_blank">33</a>!) Lots of stuff here that was new to me, and which has stuck with me since. Mostly single tracks in this list, with a couple of exceptions, including some of my favorite new discoveries from the month: <a href="http://www.domlanena.com/home.html" target="_blank">Dom La Nena</a> (and <a href="http://magazine.seymourprojects.com/2012/04/rosemary-standley-the-magnetic-mademoiselle-moriarty/" target="_blank">Rosemary Standley</a>)!!!, <a href="http://www.lilandmad.com/" target="_blank">Lily & Madeleine</a>, <a href="https://www.mergerecords.com/hospitality" target="_blank">Hospitality</a>&#8216;s _Trouble _record, and <a href="http://publicservicebroadcasting.net/" target="_blank">Public Service Broadcasting</a>&#8216;s _Inform &#8211; Educate &#8211; Entertain. _Enjoy the music!
