It&#8217;s been a while since I last posted (our son was born in March!), but I&#8217;m back with a hundred songs I listened to and liked in March 2014. A pretty good mix of longtime favorites like Advance Base, The Very Best, Here We Go Magic (Luke Temple), San Fermin, Angel Olson, Vance Joy, Nightmares on Wax, and Andrew Bird, and some new (to me) discoveries, like Daughter, Strand of Oaks, Forest Fire, Night Beds, and Valerie June. Hope you enjoy!
