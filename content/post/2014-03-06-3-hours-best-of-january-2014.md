In January I listened to a lot of new music. Most of the artists in this month&#8217;s playlist are represented by just one song, but some favorite records from the month included Rogue Wave&#8217;s _Nightingale Floors_ album, and Simon White&#8217;s _Silver Silver_ and _Yakiimo_ albums. This playlist clocks in at just about 3 hours. Enjoy!
