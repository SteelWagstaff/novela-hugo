Here are 100 tracks that I listened to and enjoyed in November 2013. I was into a lot of mellow, acoustic guitar music this month&#8211;lots of John Fahey and the Derek Trucks Band&#8211;things like that. I remember really enjoying Beth Orton&#8217;s _Sugaring Season_ and Mason Jennings&#8217; _Always Been_ records, listening to a lot of Richard Hawley, Josh Rouse, Jolie Holland, McCarthy Trenching, Cate le Bon, Spoon, Charlotte Gainbourg, and Mavis Staples this month.
