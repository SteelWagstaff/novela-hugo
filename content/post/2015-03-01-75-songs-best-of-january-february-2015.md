Here are 75 songs I listened to and liked in January and February of 2015. Cold months in Wisconsin, they were, but still some nice music in there for me, though not a ton of variety. I really liked the newest Clap Your Hands Say Yeah record Only Run, as well as Hurray for the Riff Raff&#8217;s Small Town Heroes, Thus Owls&#8217; Turning Rocks album, J.E. Sunde&#8217;s Shapes That Kiss the Lips of God, and PHOX&#8217;s PHOX [both are from Northern Wisconsin!]. I also listened to a ton of Saintseneca, Marissa Nadler and John Fullbright (the last two were both new discoveries for me). Enjoy!
