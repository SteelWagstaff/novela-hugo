Here are 100 songs I listened to and liked in February 2014. A little less variety than in previous months, perhaps. Representing a few groups/albums pretty heavily. I was most excited about Beck&#8217;s new _Morning Phase_ album, and also listened to a lot of Willy Mason, Paul Simon, Ana Tijoux, Luke Temple, Goldfrapp, J Roddy Walston and the Business, Mitote (a [group of friends][1] which features [Alex E. Chávez][2], an ethnomusicologist/anthropologist whose job talk I filmed a year or so ago, and really enjoyed). Volcano Choir&#8217;s _Repave _album, and The Mountain Goats&#8217; _All Hail West Texas_. Enjoy!
