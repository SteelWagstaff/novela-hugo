It&#8217;s been almost a year since I stopped doing the radio show (how time flies!). I miss it&#8211;the weekly scramble to develop a compelling theme, pull together a play list, get my songs and files in order, set up the segways and get on the air. Being on the radio was a blast, and Pete and everyone else at WSUM were great to me. Perhaps one day I&#8217;ll be back on the air with another show, but for now, it seems a long ways away. 

In lieu of an actual weekly radio program, I&#8217;ve decided to start a small little series here of [Spotify][1] playlists. I&#8217;ll try to put out one a week for the forseeable future. I&#8217;m starting with starred songs from the first year and a half I used Spotify (it looks like the first song I ever &#8216;starred&#8217; was on July 31, 2011). This isn&#8217;t a very carefully curated list, and you&#8217;ll see a pretty heavy concentration of M. Ward, Mississippi John Hurt, The Mountain Goats, and Sean Hayes, as well as a fair number of tracks I&#8217;d certainly not star if I heard today, but I think it&#8217;s still worth a listen. Enjoy!
