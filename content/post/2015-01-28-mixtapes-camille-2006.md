Here&#8217;s the 2006 mixtape I made for my sister. The second track was Primal Scream&#8217;s &#8220;Country Girl&#8221; and Nouvelle Vague&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://youtu.be/J5j-ipGFcko" target="_blank">Dancing with Myself</a>&#8221; and Serena Ryder&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ0-Vk4tl0I" target="_blank">Sisters of Mercy</a>&#8221; cover versions came between &#8220;Maybe Sparrow&#8221; and &#8220;The Greatest&#8221; on the actual disc, but Spotify doesn&#8217;t have those songs. Enjoy!
