Here&#8217;s a playlist of 7 hours of music I listened to and enjoyed in January 2018. Happy New Year and all that. Records I spent a bit of time with were Villagers&#8217; _Darling Arithmetic_, Monster Rally&#8217;s _Flowering Jungle_ and Liam Hayes&#8217; _Slurrup_, but it was a good month all around, and fairly eclectic. Hope you enjoy!
