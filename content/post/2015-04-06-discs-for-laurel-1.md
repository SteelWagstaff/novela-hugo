Sometime after Laurel and I got together, I realized that she spent a fair amount of her time in her car for her job, and that her car had a CD player. So I made her a set of CD mixes for when she was driving around. Here&#8217;s the first of these discs:



A few songs are missing from Spotify&#8217;s library, including Alvin Youngblood Hart&#8217;s cover of &#8220;Here Am I, Oh Lord, Send Me,&#8221; (first song) Bonnie &#8220;Prince&#8221; Billy&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrzizmWl-8" target="_blank">Easy Does It</a>,&#8221; (between &#8220;The Littlest Birds&#8221; and &#8220;Beacon Hill&#8221;) and Joanna Newsom&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LgQhfusf_E" target="_blank">Does Not Suffice</a>&#8221; (between &#8220;Beacon Hill&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Darwin&#8221;).
