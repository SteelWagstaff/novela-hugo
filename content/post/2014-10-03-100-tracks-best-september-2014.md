Here&#8217;s a playlist of 100 songs I listened to and liked from the month of September. Some favorites from the month were Sarah Jaffe, The War on Drugs, Flume, Shad, Larry Gus&#8217;s _Years Not Living_, Eef Barzelay&#8217;s new _Girls Come First_ EP, Snorri Helgason&#8217;s _I&#8217;m Going to Put My Name On Your Door_,  Tamikrest&#8217;s _Chatma_, Hammock&#8217;s _Oblivion Hymns_, Bellows&#8217; _Blue Breath_ record,  Josephine Foster&#8217;s _I&#8217;m a Dreamer _album,  and some classic Don McLean (I listened to this with Cedar and thought of my dad, who introduced me to Don McLean).

Enjoy!
