Brace yourself, because it&#8217;s a lot of music coming here: 145 songs I listened to and enjoyed in August 2016. So much good sound in my ears this month. We joined Spotify family premium, which meant that I listened to a lot more music (no more annoying advertisements! high quality streaming audio! hooray!) in August. The total playlist clocks in just over ten hours long this month, and is totally worth it. Enjoy!
