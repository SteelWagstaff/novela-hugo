How else can you follow three weeks of LGBTQ music than by moving into the rainbow? In preparing for this show, I learned that Harry Chapin was right: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVpkzZpDBA" target="_blank">There <em>are</em> so many colors in the rainbow.</a>&#8221; We took a look at ROY songs, songs whose titles corresponded to the warm end of that spectrum [Red, Orange, & Yellow]. The recording equipment in the studio wasn&#8217;t working this week. Sorry. You can listen to the Spotify playlist below, however, to hear most of what we played this week.
