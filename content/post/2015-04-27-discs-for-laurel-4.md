Here&#8217;s the fourth disc I made for Laurel to listen to while driving around for her job a few years back:  


Joanna Newsom&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_47_CHdzHI" target="_blank">Easy</a>&#8221; wasn&#8217;t in Spotify&#8217;s library, but it came between &#8220;Human Thing&#8221; and &#8220;Suckas Don&#8217;t Respect It&#8221; on the original disc.
