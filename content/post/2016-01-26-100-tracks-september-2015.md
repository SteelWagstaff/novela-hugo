Here&#8217;s a playlist of 100 songs I listened to and enjoyed in September 2015. It was a good month for me musically, with a lot of artist variety (it was the first month I started using Spotify&#8217;s <a href="http://qz.com/571007/the-magic-that-makes-spotifys-discover-weekly-playlists-so-damn-good/" target="_blank">Discover Weekly</a> feature&#8211;which I love!). The songs themselves are mostly low-key singer-songwriter types: pretty mellow, pretty lovely, pretty chill. Hope you enjoy!
