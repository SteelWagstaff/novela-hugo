I started out thinking I&#8217;d just do one show on music made by artists who identified in some way as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgedendered, and/or queer. And then I started listening, and listening, and listening, and couldn&#8217;t trim the list down to one brief show. So this is the first part in what ended up being three great weeks of music by artists identifying somewhere along the LGBTQ spectrum.
