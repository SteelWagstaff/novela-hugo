In September I remember listening to a few artists and albums pretty heavily: Ghostpoet&#8217;s _Peanut Butter Blues and Melancholy Jam_, Frazey Ford&#8217;s _Obadiah_, Eleanor Friedberger&#8217;s _Personal Record_, Baths&#8217; _Obsidian_, Nathaniel Rateliff&#8217;s _Falling Faster Than You Can Run_, Mika&#8217;s _The Origin of Love_, Efterklang&#8217;s _Magic Chairs_, The Duckworth Lewis Method&#8217;s cricket concept album _Sticky Wickets_, J Roddy Walston and the Business&#8217;s _Essential Tremors_, Fruit Bats&#8217; _Tripper_, and the Richard Swift Collection. Not much new stuff outside of those records, but there was a lot of sound that I enjoyed from those records, for sure.
