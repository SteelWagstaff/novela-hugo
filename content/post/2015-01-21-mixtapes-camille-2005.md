Here&#8217;s the 2005 mixtape I made for my sister. Sun Kil Moon&#8217;s cover of Modest Mouse&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydNhrHXHjAk" target="_blank">Neverending Math Equation&#8221;</a> was included between &#8220;Made for TV Movie&#8221; and &#8220;You are a Runner and I Am My Father&#8217;s Son,&#8221; but Spotify doesn&#8217;t have that song. Enjoy!
