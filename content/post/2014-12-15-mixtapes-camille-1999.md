Here&#8217;s the 1999 mix I made for my sister. I included the live acoustic version of Live&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htdwtTdJd7g#t=0m06s" target="_blank">They Stood Up for Love</a>&#8221; as well as two missing tracks right before Built To Spill&#8217;s &#8220;The Plan&#8221; at the end of the disc: Bonny &#8216;Prince&#8217; Billy&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHFldNEkwSc" target="_blank">A Minor Place</a>&#8221; and Smog&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9KcVRwRfkk" target="_blank">Let&#8217;s Move to the Country</a>,&#8221; but Spotify doesn&#8217;t have either song. Enjoy!
