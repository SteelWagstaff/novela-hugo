Here are 50 songs that I listened to and liked in June 2014. Dug back into Aden (a fairly obscure band I liked as a freshman in college, and hadn&#8217;t listened to in more than a decade!&#8211;fronted by Phil Gramm&#8217;s son, no less), really enjoyed Julie Doiron&#8217;s So Many Days record and Mutual Benefit&#8217;s Love&#8217;s Crushing Diamond, and listened to a fair amount of old blues, including Blind Lemon Jefferson and Furry Lewis. Also dug out the Sharon Van Etten Tramp record, which is still great.
