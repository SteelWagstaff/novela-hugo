For most of the past decade, our Wagstaff family tradition has been to run a single, simple gift exchange for Christmas. Instead of buying presents, we draw one family member&#8217;s name and then make them a gift to be presented to them at next year&#8217;s Christmas. It&#8217;s been a great experience for everyone&#8211;we&#8217;ve all wasted less money buying things others didn&#8217;t really need, we&#8217;ve learned all kinds of skills and handcrafts, and given and received beautiful, meaningful gifts to each other.

In 2010, I drew my youngest sister Camille, who loves to sing and who&#8217;s often asked me for musical recommendations over the years. I decided that as part of her gift, I&#8217;d make a series of mixtapes, one for each year of her life (she was born in 1990). In addition to the normal mixtape rules (can&#8217;t have 2 songs by the same artist, etc.) there was an additional constraint: the songs on each album had to have been released in the year in question. Making these was a blast and a real challenge, especially as I tried to offer a reflection of the range and variety of music released in that year. Below, I present the 1990 mix I made for Camille&#8217;s Christmas gift. I&#8217;m sure I left some gems out, but I leave it for you to judge the quality of 1990&#8217;s musical vintage.

Music-loving friends, if you were making this record, what else would you have included?
