Here&#8217;s a playlist of 65 songs I listened to and liked in October 2015. Four and a quarter hours of good musics. Some new discoveries for me this month that I really enjoyed were <a href="http://www.lizvice.com/" target="_blank">Liz Vice</a>, <a href="http://maxfrost.net/music/" target="_blank">Max Frost</a>, <a href="http://deadoceans.com/artist.php?name=mcguiremark" target="_blank">Mark McGuire</a>, and <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/faux-jean-mn0000792310/biography" target="_blank">Faux Jean</a> (the old project of one of my neighbors&#8211;Matty Schindler&#8211;who knew!)Â Enjoy the sounds, everybody.
