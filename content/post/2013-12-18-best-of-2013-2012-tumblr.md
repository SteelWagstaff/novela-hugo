As the year ends, it offers all kinds of opportunities for reflection. For me, the year generally feels like a ceaseless whirlwind, mostly enjoyable, but very fast-paced, and without natural break points or times built-in reflection and gathering. Because these times aren&#8217;t built in to my life, and I haven&#8217;t been very good about establishing the habit of regular reflection or regathering, the end of the year often offers the best and most natural time for me to think back on what&#8217;s transpired in the year previous&#8211;as I do I nearly always remember all kinds of things&#8211;ideas, media, experiences, etc.&#8211;that profoundly moved or intrigued me and which I had forgotten. Needless to say, it&#8217;s a fun experience.

At the end of this year, I decided to paw through my Tumblr feed from the past two years (using both the [Tumblr archive][1] feature and [this very nifty tool][2] as my helper), looking for all the music I posted or shared, either through audio files or video links. I did something similar at the end of last year on Steel&#8217;s Magnolias (see the [three][3] [TUMBLR][4] [related][5] shows I did then). I&#8217;ve made two playlists, TUMBLR 2013 and TUMBLR 2012, which contain nearly all of the music I posted to Tumblr over the past 2 years. I think they&#8217;re quite compelling playlist and hope you agree:
