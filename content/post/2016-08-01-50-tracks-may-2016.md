Here are 50 songs that I listened to and enjoyed in May 2016. It was a pretty average month for me, musically, but with some fun discoveries. I really liked Cicada Rhythm (a southern folk duo who sound like The Tallest Man on Earth with cello added&#8211;beautiful combination), Connie Converse (an almost unknown 1950s singer-songwriter with a fascinating, tragic story), Cotton Jones (indie folk band from Maryland), and The Memories (a couple of stoner bros from Portland whose song &#8220;You Need A Big Man&#8221; is both ridiculous and feels like the kind of 1 minute long Safety Dance-inspired novelty song everybody needs to start off their summer right).
