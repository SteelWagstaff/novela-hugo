For the next several weeks, I&#8217;m going to be posting a new mixtape each week. Most of these were CD mixes that I made at some point in the past half dozen or so years. I don&#8217;t remember the occasion for this one, but I made it some time during the first year or two after I had moved to Wisconsin for grad school (maybe as part of a departmental mixtape exchange?). The only songs that didn&#8217;t make it into the Spotify list were <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=375eARe1vNQ" target="_blank">this live acoustic version of Beck performing Rosalie</a> (between the Jayhawks and Turin Brakes) and the Travis b-side <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWKbJWt3iLM" target="_blank">Only Molly Knows</a>, sandwiched between Hayden and Feist.

Enjoy!
