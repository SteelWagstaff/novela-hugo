Here&#8217;s the second of a set of several discs I made for Laurel several years ago for her to listen to while driving.  


There was a song that Spotify doesn&#8217;t have in their library. It&#8217;s a great tune by a Ghanaian group, but I don&#8217;t remember the group&#8217;s name of the song title, so it&#8217;s a mystery. Enjoy!
