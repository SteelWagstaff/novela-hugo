Here&#8217;s the 2003 mixtape I made for my sister. I spent the first 8 months without any music, living in England, before returning to college in August of this year. On the plane ride home, I listened to the airplane music station, taking obsessive notes and soaking up all the sounds. It had been a long time without good music (almost 2 years). Bonnie &#8216;Prince&#8217; Billy&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfRsSVcRfqQ" target="_blank">Three Questions</a>&#8221; should be between &#8220;Not Even Stevie Nicks&#8221; and &#8220;Time is Running Out&#8221;. Enjoy!
