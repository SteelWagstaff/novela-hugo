Here are 100 songs I listened to and enjoyed in June of 2016. It was a good summer month, in life and in music for me. Favorite discoveries included: first peoples songwriter Willie Dunn, psychadelic weirdo Jib Kidder (Sean Schuster-Craig), Donnie Trumpet & the Social Experiment, legendary blueswoman Elizabeth Cotten, Ethiopian jazz master Mulatu Astatke, Malawian musician Gasper Nali, and English folksinger Mike Cooper.

Songs I listened to most this month: Odetta&#8217;s &#8220;Hit or Miss (live)&#8221;, Kim Jung Mi&#8217;s &#8220;Haenim&#8221;, Miriam Makaba&#8217;s &#8220;Pata Pata&#8221;, The Meters&#8217; &#8220;Hand Clapping Song&#8221;, Spirits of the Red City&#8217;s &#8220;Halfway Poem&#8221;, Rostam&#8217;s &#8220;Wood&#8221;, and Greg Holden&#8217;s &#8220;Boys in the Street&#8221;.

Enjoy!
